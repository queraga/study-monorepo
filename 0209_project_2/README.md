# 0209 Project 2 â€“ Mini Image Gallery with Animation

## Description
This project implements a simple **image gallery**.  
- On the right side, small preview images (thumbnails) are displayed.  
- Clicking on a thumbnail updates the large **main image** on the left.  
- A small **click animation** is applied to thumbnails for better interactivity.  

## Technologies
- HTML  
- CSS (grid, flexbox, hover/active animation)  
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event listeners)

## How it works
1. The gallery layout is created dynamically with JavaScript.  
2. Thumbnails are displayed in a vertical list on the right.  
3. When a user clicks a thumbnail, the corresponding image opens in the main area.  
4. Thumbnails scale slightly when clicked to provide feedback.
