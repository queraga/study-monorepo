# HW31 â€“ SASS Practice: Variables, Mixins, and Media Queries

## Description  
This homework is a continuation of SASS practice.  
The task focused on using **variables**, **mixins**, and **media queries** to organize and simplify styles.  

## Task  
- Create a responsive container (`.adaptiveContainer`) with different widths depending on screen size.  
- Use **variables** for colors and sizes.  
- Create **mixins** to reuse style logic across elements.  
- Style buttons (`.button`) with background colors, hover effects, and consistent spacing.  

## Technologies  
- HTML  
- SASS (compiled to CSS)  

## Result  
- The container resizes automatically on smaller screens.  
- Buttons are styled consistently using SASS mixins and variables.  
- The project demonstrates how **SASS improves maintainability and reusability** of styles.
